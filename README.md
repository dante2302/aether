<br>

---

<br>
<h3>Any user interaction( joining a channel, liking / creating a post, leaving a comment ) is limited and the user is prompted to login or create an account</h3>
<img src="./readme_assets/login.png">
<br>

--- 

<br>
<h3>User input is properly validated </h3>

### File Structure  
📁
- **components/**: Contains all the React components used in the application. Each component has its own directory for better modularization.
  - **Channel/**: Contains components related to the channel feature.
  - **Home/**: Components related to the home page.
  - ...

- **contexts/**: Contains context providers for managing global state using React's Context API.

- **hooks/**: Custom hooks for reusable logic across the application.

- **services/**: Contains service modules for handling API calls and business logic.

- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.
----

### Routing  
🛣️

  **Router** - Aether is using the default BrowserRouter, prodided by React-Router.  
  **Routes** - All routes are defined in the App.jsx component.  
  **Route Guards** : 
  - Non-existent routes :
    ```jsx
    <Route path='/*' element={<Page404 />} />
    ```
  - Unexpected errors :
    ```jsx
    <Route path="/error" element={<ErrorPage />}/>
    ```
-----

### Request Handling  
  **request.js**  
  An http request abstraction using the fetch api, that has the following structure:
  ```
    get(url, accessToken)
    post(url,accessToken,bodyData)
    put(url, accessToken, newData)
    Delete(url, accessToken, bodyData)
  ```
  Each of these methods returns the raw Response object. 
    
  ***record*Service.js**   
  - A collection of services for each of the database records 
  - Using the aforementioned *request.js* abstraction  
  - Main function is handling request routes and CRUD operations for the repspective record
  
-----

### Error Handling  
⚠️

  #### Local & Async    
  ```jsx
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  try{
    // ...do something, fetch, etc.
  }
  catch(e){
    navigate("/error");
  }
  ```
  #### Global
  
  ```jsx
    <GlobalErrorBoundary>
      // Routes, Components, etc
    </GlobalErrorBoundary>
    // wraps around components 
    // detects synchronious errors using the getDerivedStateFromError method on Component class
    // renders Error component
  ```
  
----

        </button>
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

### Authentication  
🔒
  - #### authService.js
    Responsible for API requests to the backend, expects an accessToken in return
  - #### LogIn.jsx & SignUp.jsx
    Responsible for taking in user input and executing a request through authService  
    Validation is internal
  
  - After successful authentication response from the server,  the userData, along with the accessToken (JWT) are stored inside a [Context](#context-handling)  
  - After a failed authentication there's instant feedback and limiting of sending wrong auth data requests
-----
### Context Handling  
🗂️

  - ####  UserData Context
    ##### Returns `[userData, setUserData]`
    ##### Authentication Management
      Stores and serves the accessToken needed for authenticated actions  
    
    ##### User Data Passing
      Makes userData accessible to all components  

  - ####  UserModal Context
    
    ##### Modal State Control
      Tracks and serves whether the modal is open or closed, allowing components to respond accordingly.

-----

### Styling  
🎨

#### Global Styles

Global styles and variables, such as font sizes, weights, and colors, are defined in `index.css` using CSS custom properties.

#### Component Styles
CSS Modules (`Component.module.css`) are used for component-specific styles.  
In every Component folder, there's a styles folder, containing the respective CSS module for each component

-----

### Dependencies

### Introduction
🌟
The backend of Aether is a REST API, built with the following technologies:
 - **.NET 8**
   - **Minimal API**
   - **ADO.NET**
 - **PostgreSQL**
 - 
-----

### Project Structure
📁
- **Api/**: Contains the main API logic and configurations.
  - **Endpoints/**: Directory for API endpoint definitions.
  - **Middleware/**: Custom middleware for error handling, authentication, etc.
  - **ServiceRegister.cs**: Registers services and dependencies for dependency injection.
  - **appsettings.json**: Configuration file for general application settings.

- **Models/**: Contains the data models and related classes.
  - **DbRecords/**: Classes representing database records.
  - **Helpers/**: Helper classes for models.

- **Services/**: Contains the business logic and service classes.
  - **Exceptions/**: Custom exceptions used across the services.
  - **Helpers/**: Helper classes for services.
  - **Services/**: Directory containing various service implementations.

-----

### Configuration
⚙️
 ##### Configuration Sources

   - Azure Environment Variables: Connection String, Token Signing Credentials.

   - appsettings.json: Default application settings.
 ##### Implementation
 ```csharp
 IConfiguration config =  new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
            .AddEnvironmentVariables()
            .Build();
 ```
-----

### Services
🛠️
 ###### DbService.cs
  Any connection to the database is handled through this abstract class. Derived services do not access the db connection.  
  
 - **Configuration Initialization**
   - Using Dependency Injection for the configuration itself
   - Retrieves the connection string from the configuration.
   - Handles potential configuration issues.
 
 - **Methods**
   - **`RecordExistsAsync<T>`**: Checks if a record exists asynchronously with various overloads to support different parameter types.
   - **`RecordExistsUnionAsync<T,F>`**: Checks if a record exists based on two columns and their values asynchronously.
   - **`ExecuteQueryCommandAsync<T>`**: Executes a query and retrieves a single record asynchronously.
   - **`ExecuteQueryListCommandAsync<T>`**: Executes a query and retrieves a list of records asynchronously.
   - **`ExecuteNonQueryCommandAsync`**: Executes commands asynchronously.
   - **`ExecuteScalarAsync`**: Executes a scalar command and retrieves a single value.
  
  ##### DbService Derivatives
   Any service derived from the DbService class can use all the listed methods  
   Handles CRUD operations and any other SQL query , as well as data collision  
   Default data for Db Records is handled by the service, but if not, the database is configured to handle it  
   Error handling is done by thrown exceptions
   

-----

### Endpoints
More information about the API's endpoints can be found in
<a href="./readme_assets/Endpoints.md">Endpoints.md</a>

-----

### Auth
🔒
 Aether user JWT for it's authentication. JWT signing credentials are passed down from azure environment variables.
 Endpoints are authenticated by default, and those which aren't use `.AllowAnonymous()` method at the end of declaration.
 
 Authentication is handled with the help of the following classes:
   ##### AuthenticationResult
   
```csharp
class AuthenticationResult
{
  bool IsSuccessful;
   User UserData;
}
```

   ##### AuthService.cs
   
```csharp
class AuthService
{
   // Takes a newly generated user or a logged in user and returns the JWT used for authentication
   string GenerateToken(Guid id);

   // Veirifies hashed password and returns an AuthenticationResult that's handled in the endpoint method itself
   AuthenticationResult Authenticate(UserCredentials u);

   // Ensures user identity, hashes password and creates a db record of the user and his credentials
   User SignUp(SignUpData s); 
}
```
     
 More information about the Auth Middleware in the [Middleware Section.](#middleware)
 
-----

### Middleware
🌐

 **Auth Middleware**
  - GET Endpoints and "/auth" endpoints are not authenticated by the middleware
    (Some Authentication for GET endpoints is handled inside the endpoints themselves - comparing jwt signing key with data provided)
  - Returns 403 Forbidden If:
    - User Identity is not authenticated in the http context
    - userId JWT claim is null
    - userId JWT claim is not a valid Guid

      <br>
      
 **Exception Handler**  
 Basic exception handler for catching exceptions thrown by services or internal exceptions. Returns an http response with a messsage(if passed).

Catch clauses
 - BadHttpRequestException => 400
 - NotFoundException => 404
 - ConflictException => 409
 - InvalidConfigurationException => 500
 - NpgsqlException => 500 + details ( non-sensitive )
 - Exception => 500
