# Production Deployment Branch (client-side)

## Purpose
This Git branch is dedicated exclusively to deploying client-side code to production using Vercel. Its sole purpose is to ensure that only verified and tested client-side code reaches the production environment.

## Guidelines
1. **Code Restrictions**: Only finalized, tested, and approved client-side code should be merged into this branch.
   
2. **Version Control**: Use this branch strictly for managing deployment-ready versions of your client-side application. It should reflect the current production state at all times.

3. **Deployment Automation**: Vercel is configured to automatically deploy from this branch. Any push or merge into this branch triggers a deployment to the production environment.
